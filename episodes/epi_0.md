    * Homelessness stressed me; I need away to my head a rest from sad stories and got into robotics
   * Embedded PCB design, machine learning, data engineering

## What we are doing? 
Talking about how humans use information to make decisions.  And occasionally data, machine learning, family, psychology, philosophy, and an odd robot.

##  The myth of the Daddy Longlegs
1. Talk about the Whiskey and Pancakes episode mentioning Daddy Long-Legs being the most venomous spider in the world. 
2. Tell the story of a college friend claiming it was the most toxic spider in the world.
3. Friend explains away it not killing people saying, “Its fangs aren’t sharp enough to pierce the skin.” Talk about [Cognitive Dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance).

> In the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance is the perception of contradictory information. Relevant items of information include a person's actions, feelings, ideas, beliefs, and values, and things in the environment. Cognitive dissonance is typically experienced as psychological stress when they participate in an action that goes against one or more of them. According to this theory, when two actions or ideas are not psychologically consistent with each other, people do all in their power to change them until they become consistent. [[1]](#1)

## Empiricism and Ground Truth

Empiricism, often used by natural scientists, says that "knowledge is based on experience" and that "knowledge is tentative and probabilistic, subject to continued revision and falsification". [[2]](#2)

Ground truth is a term used in various fields to refer to information that is known to be real or true, provided by direct observation and measurement (i.e. empirical evidence) as opposed to information provided by inference.


So, what is the truth about the Daddy Longlegs?

> Daddy longlegs,, also called harvestman, are any of more than 6,000 species of arachnids (class Arachnida) that are known for their extremely long and thin legs and for their compact bodies. Daddy longlegs are closely related to scorpions (order Scorpiones) but, because of their appearance, are often mistaken as spiders (order Araneida or Araneae). However, unlike true spiders, in which the body is divided into two distinct segments (the cephalothorax and the abdomen), daddy longlegs look as though they have only one segment, because of a broad fusion that makes the juncture between the two segments almost indiscernible. [[3]](#3)

## Why does it matter?
* Story of getting a job in homeless services
* Broadening one’s experience helps them have ground truths by which to navigate the world--rather than a world full of misinformation. Additional reading: [Broaden and Build model](https://www.verywellmind.com/broaden-and-build-theory-4845903).
